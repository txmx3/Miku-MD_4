## ‚úß‚úß‚úß Vulnerability Report (‚úîÔ∏è Fixed on 06/11/2022 -  3:18 pm IST)
- In a recent vulnerability test `( On 04/11/22 - 9:10 am IST )` I found that this bot contains a major vulnerability which can let `your WhatsApp accout be accessed by the Attacker`. Actually every 3rd party things contains some hidden vulnerability but here I am sharing that vulnerability with you as an warning. Which is `only effective if you use repl.it scanner`. [ It will be fixed soon so don't worry. ]

- It can be avoided by installing bot in `Termux`, `VS code` etc. physical deploy methods or using other session generators.
- I made this bot as an open source project but as it's dev I don't want user's account to be hacked. So I am working to fix it as soon as possible.
- Stay safe and stay updated.

<br>

### ‚úß‚úß Update Report (06/11/2022 -  3:18 IST)
- Vulnerability has been `fixed` by me so no worries.
- This bot doesn't contains any security related vulnerabilities anymore.
